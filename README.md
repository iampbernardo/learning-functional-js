# Learning project for diving into Functional Programming in JS

## Reasons why I want to learn functional programming:

- I need some paradigm shift that requires an intelectual challenge
- Want to stay up to date with some coding skills 


## Why in JS?

I want to learn something like Haskell or Clojure, but first I think that starting with FP through a language I know about can be a good starting point.
